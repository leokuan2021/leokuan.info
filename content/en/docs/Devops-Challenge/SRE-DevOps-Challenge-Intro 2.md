title: SRE/DevOps Challenge
date: 2022-03-06T16:19:44-10:00

I came across this challenge while lurking /r/devops looking for ideas for demo projects.

/u/IndieDiscovery was given a week to complete the challenge. Another user estimated this to take about 15 hours.

I was initially taken aback by the challenge's scale as 15 hours for the challenge itself and like 10 more hours for documentation is a significant amount of time for someone who already has a demanding full-time job. But I figured I would give it a try since it covers a decent range of tools and it would be beneficial for my learning and testing my skills. 

I googled a little bit and it doesn't seem like anyone posted their solutions to the challenge so here's the documentation of my attempt at this challenge.



This documentation will read a little weird due to its intended audience and purpose. I will be conflating tutorial, how-to guides, explanation and reference all in one documentation to serve a specific purpose, i.e. to demonstrate my understanding of the subject to potential employers. 

It's not perfect and it's by design. I do know what constitutes good documentation.
