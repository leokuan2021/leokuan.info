Each part’s README should include:

    Instructions on how to run each part of the challenge.
    Brief description of rationale behind each tool/language/framework of choice.
    Brief description of key challenges. It’s okay to say you are not sure what you did was the best way to solve it. Be sure to justify your decision.
    Note any caveats and potential failure scenarios.
    Note what you would do differently in a production environment.
